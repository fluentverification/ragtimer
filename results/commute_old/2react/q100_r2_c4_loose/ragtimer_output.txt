The traces recorded and the information on those traces are stored in 'reaction_list.txt'

The traces by themselves (i.e. for simulation and commuting) are found in 'trace_list.txt'

State graph built. Appending cycles where allowable.
Added 45 cycles, with 2 new states and 6 transitions.
Removed 0 dead-end states and 0 probability sink states (total 0 states).
Removed 0 corresponding transitions.

Final Count:

Establishing an absorbing state.
Begin printing model files.
Now printing 100 paths to PRISM model files.
Now printing 100 paths to STORM model files.

BEGIN ERROR CHECKING
If an inconsistency is found in the state space, its details will be provided here.
Otherwise, assume the generated state-space is error-free.
This is an added confidence booster for the probability results.

Welcome to RAGTIMER. At present, this is two tools joined together. We are working on joining them together more seamlessly but appreciate your patience with this prototype tool.
I will generate traces, then commute.
I am assuming you have placed your model in the following files:
model.ragtimer (in the RAGTIMER format; see README)
model.prop (file with property without time constraints in first line, i.e., x=10 )
model.sm (prism model file)
model.csl (prism csl property)

_commute/options.txt
Running RAGTIMER trace generation
/home/landonjefftaylor/combined_ragtimer/_ragtimer
Starting Commuting
Look for output files _commute/prism.* or _commute/storm.*
You can use these files in your favorite model checker.
