Welcome to RAGTIMER for trace generation.
This is a work in progress. Please submit bug reports.

Constructing a dependency graph
Finished constructing a dependency graph, found these prefixes:
r4 
r6 r4 

/home/landonjefftaylor/combined_ragtimer/_ragtimer
Finding 100
For each prefix: 100

The traces recorded and the information on those traces are stored in 'reaction_list.txt'

The traces by themselves (i.e. for simulation and commuting) are found in 'trace_list.txt'

Welcome to the model commutation tool.
Getting Parameters from input file
Model Name: ../model.sm
Trace List Name: ../commute_traces.txt
Property: s4<=25
Max Depth: 10
Time Bound: 100000.0
Terminating with depth bound
Cycle length: 4
Cycle initial values for testing: 8
Verbose mode disabled
Prism model and property loaded succesfully.
Iterating through each input trace.
Expect this to run silently for a moment.
Welcome to RAGTIMER. At present, this is two tools joined together. We are working on joining them together more seamlessly but appreciate your patience with this prototype tool.
I will generate traces, then commute.
I am assuming you have placed your model in the following files:
model.ragtimer (in the RAGTIMER format; see README)
model.prop (file with property without time constraints in first line, i.e., x=10 )
model.sm (prism model file)
model.csl (prism csl property)

Running RAGTIMER trace generation
/home/landonjefftaylor/combined_ragtimer/_ragtimer
Starting Commuting
Look for output files _commute/prism.* or _commute/storm.*
You can use these files in your favorite model checker.
