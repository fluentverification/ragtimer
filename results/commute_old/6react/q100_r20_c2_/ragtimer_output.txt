Welcome to RAGTIMER for trace generation.
This is a work in progress. Please submit bug reports.

Constructing a dependency graph
Finished constructing a dependency graph, found these prefixes:

Finding 100
For each prefix: 100

Welcome to the model commutation tool.
Getting Parameters from input file
Model Name: ../model.sm
Trace List Name: ../commute_traces.txt
Property: s4<=25
Max Depth: 20
Time Bound: 100000.0
Terminating with depth bound
Cycle length: 2
Cycle initial values for testing: 4
Verbose mode disabled
Prism model and property loaded succesfully.
Iterating through each input trace.
Expect this to run silently for a moment.
Welcome to RAGTIMER. At present, this is two tools joined together. We are working on joining them together more seamlessly but appreciate your patience with this prototype tool.
I will generate traces, then commute.
I am assuming you have placed your model in the following files:
model.ragtimer (in the RAGTIMER format; see README)
model.prop (file with property without time constraints in first line, i.e., x=10 )
model.sm (prism model file)
model.csl (prism csl property)

Starting Commuting
Look for output files _commute/prism.* or _commute/storm.*
You can use these files in your favorite model checker.
