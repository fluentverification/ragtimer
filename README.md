# RAGTIMER
Random Assume Guarantee Testing Induced Model Executions for Reachability (RAGTIMER)

## IVy Model Generator
Documentation for the IVy model generator is coming soon.

## Dependency Graph
Dependency graph processing documentation can be found at [docs/dependency.md](docs/dependency.md)

## Running RAGTIMER
Run instructions coming soon, but it will just involve either calling a Python script or compiling an executable.

For now, the necessary Python scripts are included in the `scripts` folder, and the RAGTIME and PRISM models are in the `models` folder.
